# Controls Library

This directory contains reusable security controls used across the threat models
in this repository.

## How to use
1. Start from `00-how-to-use.md`
2. Pick controls from `01-controls-catalog/`
3. Use `02-controls-mapping/` to map controls to Azure/AWS/GCP/AI/A2A
4. Use `03-checklists/` for quick architecture review baselines

## Design principles
- Controls are implementation-agnostic by default (pattern-first)
- Each control includes validation steps and evidence artifacts
- Platform mappings are provided separately
