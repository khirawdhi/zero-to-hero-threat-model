# Threat Modeling 101 (Practical)

Threat modeling is a structured way to answer:
1) What are we building?
2) What can go wrong?
3) What will we do about it?
4) Did we do a good job?

## What you model (minimum)
- External entities
- Processes/services
- Data stores
- Data flows
- Trust boundaries

## STRIDE (quick)
- S: Spoofing identity
- T: Tampering with data or code
- R: Repudiation (no auditability)
- I: Information disclosure
- D: Denial of service
- E: Elevation of privilege

## Output you want
- A diagram (DFD + trust boundaries)
- A list of threats (STRIDE) with scenarios
- A prioritized set of mitigations
- A test plan to validate controls
